# VM

Simple little computer 3 (LC3) virtual machine

# Compile and run

To compile the code use the following command for *gcc*

`gcc lc3.c -o lc3`

This will create the runnable file that can then be used to run either the **2048** or **Rogue** games that are within this repo

Example running command

`./lc3 path/to/2048.obj`

**ENJOY**
